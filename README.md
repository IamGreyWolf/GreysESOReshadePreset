# GreysESOReshadePreset
I worked on a light-weight, high performant yet beautiful ESO reshade preset.

## How to install
0. Download the ZIP file GreysReshade.zip
1. Go to your ESO installation folder. (Usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Zenimax Online\The Elder Scrolls Online\game\client)
2. Make sure to remove any remnants of existing reshade installation (Make a backup). If you are not sure which files are relevant, check this link: https://reshade.me/forum/general-discussion/4398-howto-uninstall-reshade
3. Unzip the GreysReshade.zip file into your games client folder
4. Start game, tweak to your liking or not and enjoy.

*Note: * You can activate Performance Mode within Reshade menu in game.
*Note 2: * To open the reshade menu, press pos1
