# GreysESOReshadePreset
I worked on a light-weight, high performant yet beautiful ESO reshade preset.

## How to install
0. Download the ZIP file GreysReshade.zip
1. Go to your ESO installation folder. (Usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Zenimax Online\The Elder Scrolls Online\game\client)
2. Make sure to remove any remnants of existing reshade installation (Make a backup). If you are not sure which files are relevant, check this link: https://reshade.me/forum/general-discussion/4398-howto-uninstall-reshade
3. Unzip the GreysReshade.zip file into your games client folder
4. Start the game
5. Open reshade by pressing POS1 / F2
6. Activate all the effects if they are inactive
7. Set Performance mode in the bottom right
8. Close menu and enjoy

*Note: * You can activate Performance Mode within Reshade menu in game.

*Note 2: * To open the reshade menu, press pos1

## Effects in use
1. MultiLUT - using a color table I changed the colors of the game to change the overall very purple-ish shadow tint and make the colors pop more and more natural
2. AmbientLight- Adds a soft glow to certain illuminated areas without interfering with your map or other UI views.
3. AdaptiveSharpen - Gives the image and textures way more clarity and sharpness
4. EyeAdaption - Makes sure highlights and shadows never get too strong
